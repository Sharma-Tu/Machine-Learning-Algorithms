# Machine Learning Algorithms

Basic regression and classification algorithms implemented using gradient descent and expectation maximization.

## Expectation Maximization for mixture of gaussians

Here we have two gaussian distributions simulated with preset parameters as mu = [30.0,6.0] and sigma = [1.0,1.5]. The figure below shows the estimated distributions using EM algorithm.
